I am a passionate guy who loves **Artificial Intelligence** and how we can as humans give machines the ability to think. This passion has made me develop a solid foundation in computer science, being able to master my ability to program in languages such as **Python, C or C++.** I have spent a lot of time consolidating my programming and computer skills until now, when I am ready to go to the next level and focus on my great passion: **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.**

If you have read my bio, you have realized that I am a student of 42. 42 is an innovative programming school based on peer learning, as people do in companies. We don't have teachers, but we have the Internet and classmates. If we have to solve a problem and we don't know how, we simply start looking for the most efficient solution.<br><br>
During this learning journey, I have developed my skills in:
