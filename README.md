# Hi, I'm Pablo 👋

I am a passionate guy who loves Artificial Intelligence and how we can, as humans, give machines the ability to think. So in a simple stop on Earth on the way home, I am currently studying C. As you can imagine, I have just started my journey, so I am trying to consolidate my programming skills before moving on to the next level.

Here are some of the notes that I have been taking during my stop on Earth. If you don't understand anything, maybe it's because you haven't read: <a href="https://www.casadellibro.com/libro-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy/9780345391803/1009645">**The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy**</a>. Once you read it, you will know what to do with all of this. If you don't want to read it, you can also take these notes, although it won't be the same:

If you have read my bio, you have realized that I am a student of 42. 42 is an innovative programming school based on peer learning, as people do in companies. We don't have teachers, but we have the Internet and classmates. If we have to solve a problem and we don't know how, we simply start looking for the most efficient solution. Thanks to this revolutionary method, we can learn and consolidate new knowledge in such a short time. To show you my tour of 42, I show you a schedule of the projects that I have completed during my 42 experience:
