# Hi, I'm Pablo 👋

I am an passionate boy who loves Artificial Intelligence and how we can, as humans, give machines the hability to think. So, in a simple stop on Earth on the way home, I am currentyly studying C. As you can imagine, I have just started my journey, so I am trying to consolidate my programming skills before going to the next level.

Here you have some of the notes that I have been taking during my stop on Earth. If you don't understadn anything maybe is because you haven't read: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Once you read it, you will know what to do with all of this. If you don't want to read it, you can also take these notes although it won't be the same:
